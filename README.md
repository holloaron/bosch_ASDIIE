The project throughout the semester is to recreate the famous minigame, Pac-Man. Pac-Man is an action maze chase video game where the player  
controls the yellow character through an enclosed maze. The objective of the game is to eat all the dots, prizes placed in the  
maze while avoiding four colored ghosts that pursue Pac-Man. When Pac-Man eats all the dots, the player advances to the next level.
